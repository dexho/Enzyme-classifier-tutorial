# Protein-classifier-tutorial
A simple SVM machine learning classifier to answer the most urgent of questions: does this membrane protein belong to water bears, or poplar trees? (representatives of brown bears vs. redwood trees, go bears!)
This framework builds a classifer for any type of coding sequence, with any two genbank assmeblies of your choosing.
